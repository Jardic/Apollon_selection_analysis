# Apollon_selection_analysis

The notebooks here were used for the analysis of SELEX NGS datasets from the Apollon project. Apollon is a deoxyribozyme which catalyzes transfer of a phosphate group from a small molecule substrate called NPP to its own 5' end. You can read about the whole Apollon project (hopefully soon) in a publication that is now in preparation.
